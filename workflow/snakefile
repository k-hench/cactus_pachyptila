     This is a snakemake adapataion of a stepwise
     execution of a progressive cactus alignment. 
     
     The pipeline execution is a two-step process,
     as the number of 'rounds' of the cactus alignment
     can not be determined before the compilation of
     the cactus instructions.

     Therefore, to run the pipeline, first call
     `snakemake <options> cactus_prep` to create the file
     "results/cactus/job_inventory.tsv" that lists the
     number of jobs within each cactus round and which is 
     needed for the rules within `cactus_stepwise.smk`.

     Then, run `snakemake <options> cactus_stepwise` for
     the actual alignment.
